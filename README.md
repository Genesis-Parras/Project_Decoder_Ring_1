# Project_Decoder_Ring_1

Project Decoder Ring

Basic Functionality:
An application that would encode or decode messages. There are three different encoder/decoder options.

1. Caesar Cypher: Will shift letters by the amoount you specify. If encode is true, it will encode the message. Ex: "hello", with 3, encode = true: "khoor". If encode is false, it will decode the message. Ex: "khoor" with -3, encode = false: "hello".

2. Substitution: Allows user to make their own alphabet to substitute the regular alphabet. Ex: "QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM" will become "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".

3. Polybius: Allows user to encode using a polybius square.

Learning objectives
This project is designed to test your ability to build complex algorithms. It will also test your ability to write unit tests with Mocha and Chai to test your algorithms.
Should have previous understanding of writing a series of unit tests using Mocha and Chai and 
using different expect() methods to test your code.
